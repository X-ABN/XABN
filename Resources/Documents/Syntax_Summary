### Summary of markup notation and usage

The basic use syntax of XABN is quite simple - consisting of a markup tag followed by text content. Markup tags are recognised by being preceded by “White Space” and ending with a “:” (colon). Anything which isn’t part of a markup tag is text content and is associated with the previous markup tag. “White Space” is more broadly defined than in XML and includes not only spaces, tabs and new lines but also other Unicode spacing and non-printing characters.

A markup tag generally consists of a property name optionally preceded by control symbols. In XML (and hence in XABN) there are two main types of “property” – these are Elements and Attributes.
